🚧 **This site is under construction and is continually being added to and updated at my own mentally healthy pace. 💭 💤 The Computer Science docs are being worked on but are not ready to be published yet!**

Two of the biggest things that weigh me down are:

- the lack of healthy and consumable insight regarding 💊**mental health** 💊,
- and the lack of focus on 💻 **web development skills** 💻, one of the most coveted skills in many industries today, in the core of collegiate Computer Science curricula, making it difficult for women who are often told they're "not as smart as men" to enter the field because they were not exposed to the same resources or experiences.

I'm passionate about **sharing knowledge** and encouraging more 💁‍♀️**ladies** 💁‍♀️ to love themselves and feel empowered to get into tech. I often worry about how the tech industry, like many other industries and cultures, is so <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisgender">cis</a> male-dominated for no good reason.

So, I built this website not only to consolidate all of my own notes and feelings, but also to hopefully help people like 👉*you* 👈:...

- Believe people can **live healthily and happily as equals**
- Digest Computer Science notes in a **straightforward and readable** way with clear examples
- Get the extra **web development knowledge** you may have missed in school
- Have a **one stop virtual shop** for all things regarding my experience in pursuing life, happiness, and success!

## Acknowledgments

### Happiness / Love

Special thanks to the following people who have helped me think this way:

- **<a class="turquoise">Daddy</a>**: Thank you for teaching me to be **courageous, smart, and open-minded to protect loved ones**. Thank you for also encouraging me of my capabilities, guiding me to have the privilege of attending your alma mater, which you are rightfully proud of. Your philosophical way of thinking was passed down to me and I am now immensely proud of and grateful for myself because of your influence.

- **<a class="turquoise">엄마</a>** _(mom)_: Thank you for teaching me to **be humble, to listen to others, and to stay positive, silly, and fun**. I've always aspired to be a mother as loving as you are and I respect and love your optimistic voice and feelings when I hear you speak.

- **<a class="turquoise">Yena</a>** _(younger sister)_: Thank you for teaching me how selfish I sound and trusting that we are **equally capable of achieving different things**. I also want to thank you for teaching me that I subconsciously copy others I want to be like. You also teach me to **control my emotions better**, and I am grateful for how you show me to **be independent**.

- **<a class="turquoise">Brandon</a>** _(boyfriend)_: Thank you for always trusting me and inspiring me to **seek knowledge in order to protect ourselves** from people who hurt us. You always encouraged me to seek knowledge on my own because you knew I had the ability, but you continually educated yourself for everyone's sake including mine. Your **ability to be compassionate to _everyone_** is something I've always admired and wanted to learn. And thank you for continually forgiving me when I make mistakes.

- **<a class="turquoise">Aria</a>** _(my Pomsky puppy)_: I'm not proud of buying a dog - I have tried to adopt multiple times because of how much people unrighteously shame people for buying dogs from breeders, but adoption centers would not trust me because of my age and race. So I had the privilege of finding and affording a well-priced beautiful puppy who, in my opinion, deserves just as much love as shelter dogs. I named her Aria because of its connotation with music, feminist _Pretty Little Liars_ energy, and tough _Game of Thrones_ energy. Thank you Aria for teaching me that humans are not so different from or smarter than pack animals, especially those we domesticated. You taught me to view both people and dogs in the same way: **selfish in either a worried or excited manner** and always wanting love.

- **<a class="turquoise">HubSpot</a>**: I am so grateful to have the privilege of working at such an **empathetic workplace**, where everyone is expected to have HEART (Humble, Empathetic, Adaptable, Remarkable, Transparent). This environment has been so supportive and has helped me feel more confident in my voice. Everyone I meet warmly encourages me to speak and share what I know and that has had a huge impact on my way of thinking. I believe that it is extremely **important for workplaces to encourage positivity and allow employees to take mental breaks when needed**, which subconsciously encourages them to work harder to share knowledge, in order to prevent being fired.

- **<a class="turquoise">Friends</a>**: I'd like to especially thank my friends Jordan, Ana, Camila, Ethan, Jennie, and Maria for being courageous enough to reach out and love me in a world that struggled to love, and continuing to convince me that I am worthy of love. **I immensely appreciate being reminded that I am helping people** during this mentally demanding time in which we must express love and solidarity to people who appear not to deserve it. I now see that everyone has been trying their best to either love me or be protective of me. The hope of love and being reaccepted and forgiven by the world is the only reason I choose to stay in this world.

### Computer Science

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) are the real MVPs - my docs basically summarize and emphasize the important things while including example usages and tutorials that I find helpful for myself when developing! 🤓

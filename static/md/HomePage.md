One of the biggest issues I had with collegiate Computer Science curricula was the lack of focus on **web development skills**, one of the most common career paths for Software Engineers.

I'm passionate about sharing knowledge and encouraging more 💁‍♀️**ladies** 💁‍♀️ to get into tech! So, I built this website not only to consolidate all of my own notes, but also to hopefully help people like 👉*you* 👈:

- Digest Computer Science notes in a **straightforward and readable** way
- Get the extra **web development knowledge** you may have missed in school

If you find yourself reading throughout my docs and have a question or see something that can be improved, please don't hesitate to reach out to me! 😊

  Good docs are simple and relatable.

One of the biggest issues I had with collegiate Computer Science curricula was the lack of focus on **web development skills**, one of the most common career paths for Software Engineers.

I'm passionate about sharing knowledge and encouraging more 💁‍♀️**ladies** 💁‍♀️ to get into tech!

So, I built this website not only to consolidate all of my own notes, but also to hopefully help people like 👉*you* 👈:

- Digest Computer Science notes in a **straightforward and readable** way with clear examples
- Get the extra **web development knowledge** you may have missed in school
- Have a **one stop virtual shop** for all things Computer Science! 🤑

[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) is the real MVP - my docs are basically summarizing notes including example usages and tutorials that I find helpful for myself when developing! 🤓

🚧 This site is under construction and is continually being added to and updated during my endless spare quarantine time. 💭💤

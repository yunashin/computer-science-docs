# Happiness

The age old question: **What makes people happy?** ðŸ¤”

Many of us have been taught the **<a class="wood" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule">Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have done unto yourself.</a>**

ðŸ”¥ **Hot Take**: I think this belief hurts people and here's why:

## Observations

_**Note:**_ I'll be referring to selfishness in a two-fold manner: **positive selfishness** (love) and **negative selfishness** (worry).

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- I was raised in a **Korean Christian (Presbyterian) household** and was therefore taught as a child to believe in God, share "His" message, spread love, and **feel extreme shame for committing "sins"** because I'd go to hell if I ever committed any of them.

- My **mom** showed me how to be **warm and loving**, while my **dad** taught me to **protect myself by pursuing knowledge open-mindedly**.

- **Americans** taught me to be **fearlessly confident in my voice**, to **apologize**, and to be **thankful**, but they also constantly assumed things about me because of my race. I always felt horrible and judged that I fit the stereotype of "being good at math" and "playing the violin".

- I get mad when people don't **believe or respect me or my loved ones**.

- Just because I attended Columbia like my dad, does not mean that's why I got in. I know plenty of people who have alumni parents who did not get in. **We are not rich and have never donated to Columbia** - my family is privileged to be a part of the upper middle class and **I've received a little over $60,000/year in financial aid and am still working on paying off my student loans**.
    - I believe that **all schools should teach the same things** so that there's no longer a stigma about "how good or smart" people can be.

- **I'm privileged for being able to travel a lot and meet many diverse people** because my friends are really good at finding the cheapest flights, and my parents didn't want to prevent me from seeing the world despite the financial burden it was for them.

- I like to be around people who either **appear to be similar to me, have the same beliefs, or are respectful enough to agree to disagree**.

- I've noticed that many **South Koreans** like myself culturally experience a lot of **worry** and **judgment** from others, and feel the need to be very **defensive** (fight instinct) in order to protect their loved ones. I often refrain from bothering others with my flaws and fears (flight instinct), especially because:
    - My grandparents grew up while **<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea_under_Japanese_rule">Japan had colonized Korea</a> and imposed Japanese teachings** in school from 1910-1945. My grandmothers still count in Japanese because of Japan's impact. And **many Koreans still hold grudges against Japan** because of how they killed disobedient people who didn't conform to Japanese ways of life, raped our women (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comfort_women">"comfort women"</a>), and **never gave a genuine apology** because Japan did not know how to properly apologize but still felt proud, much like how most people are proud and nationalistic of their homelands and loved ones.
    - My grandparents also grew up during the **<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War">Korean War</a>** that **divided Korea into North and South** in the early 1950s, and our national fear of our proximity to North Korea continues to worry me especially since **some of my grandparents' family members got stuck in and died in North Korea or China in their attempts of escaping**.

- My paternal grandfather died before I was born, and my **maternal grandfather on my 100th day of life**, a day meant to be big cultural celebration in South Korea. **My dad's brother also passed away on my 13th birthday**, which also filled me with spiritual guilt and made me think my family viewed me as unlucky and negatively selfish.

- People who constantly worry like me have adjusted to a **natural state of adrenaline rushes** and are often the ones who are unjustly mentally influenced by things like war, injustice, hurt, discrimination, and authoritarian or controlling environments, and therefore **need the most love to heal mentally**.

- **People who don't believe in or fear God choose to protect themselves** with their innate fight or flight instinct against the **hypocritical "equality" in America**, and feel the need to be extremely conservative of basic resources and be respectful towards others, especially elders. This **ultimately deprives us of self-care**, often ultimately leading to death.

- **People who believe in a loving God** feel that they need to be **kind to others at all costs**, often quite literally "carrying the weight of the world" on their shoulders.

- I believe **people are all equally smart and capable of being kind**, because I learned while I was involuntarily hospitalized for 2 weeks that almost everyone I spoke to agreed with me and returned love to me in their own individual ways.

- I've noticed that **when my body asks me to be more positively selfish** (i.e. when I am hungry, tired, confused, distracted, angry), **I tend to snap at others** and either fight (argue or politely disagree) or flight (push people away), which is what makes people tell me I'm "selfish".

- After my few near-death experiences, I've realized that **there's more I can do than just fight or flight** - I can choose to **apologize to, thank, and love the people who hurt us and show them what love is supposed to feel like**.

- I have **insomnia** because **I worry about how "good" or "bad" people perceive me as at all times** - my entire life, I've wondered what it meant to be "good" and could barely focus on anything else especially since my family would always tell me that so many of the things I did was "bad" for me based on what the world tells them.

- **People all believe or want to believe in something**, whether it be God or not, because not knowing things worries us and keeps us up at night.

- **Disagreement or inability to respect others' beliefs often breaks or damages relationships**.

- The more honest I am, the **less ashamed we feel about pooping** and I've been extremely gassy and constipated lately. Thank you, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everyone_Poops">Everyone Poops</a> ðŸ˜‚

## Conclusions

- I am currently the most selfish girl in the world, but **I choose to try to keep sharing love so that I can protect myself and my loved ones**. And I become more humble when the world believes me.

- I believe that **everyone deserves the same knowledge**, so that we can all help ourselves better without needing other people's help. I should be thankful when given knowledge and apologetic when I accidentally assume things.

- I believe that **love is a stronger currency than money** - we can exchange things with love and money while we figure out how to change the world, but there's not much in the world that we really need but love.

- People have always tried their best to believe in God and save lives but have been **miscommunicating** up until I realized I could communicate love. I told my loved ones to only **tell people they trust with love, patience, and kindness**, and people continued to share that way, continually making the world a slightly better one than the day before.

- **Uncertainty and doubt manifest in worry or fear**, which is equally contagious as love, laughter, and sneezing, but **kills people**.

- People are therefore **innately empathetic** and only **become dangerous when surrounded or taught by people who dwell on the uncertainty** of why we all feel the same and what else is out there.

- Therefore, **believing in a loving God gives us comfort and confidence in the decisions that we make** because it allows us to believe that everything we do is okay, so long as we can recognize and acknowledge our mistakes.

- I do not believe I am God - I believe **everyone's honest voices are God's voice speaking through us**, and **I view myself as a "normal" girl who never wants to grow up** and simply see a happy, loving world.

- People who believe in a loving God all are **equally smart and capable of learning more** about who we are, what our purpose is, and why we are here. I don't have all the answers and I don't think any one person does - we learn when we honestly share our equally fascinating experiences with people we trust.

- The more we **do things together** for the purpose of love, the happier the world deservingly becomes.

- We deserve to be proud when we choose to love, but I think **we should choose to love everyone equally so that wars can end once and for all**.

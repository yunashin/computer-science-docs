# yunaversal thoughts

Welcome to my yunaverse, a place where knowledge is shared for anyone who wants it. Personal happiness blog and documentation and compiled notes for all I know about Computer Science!

## Scripts

Make sure you're in the `yunaversal-thoughts` root path when typing and "Enter"-ing these commands in your Terminal.

To run the app locally, type:

```
npm start
```

To see live style changes to your `static/sass/index.sass`, type:

```
sass --watch static/sass:src/css
```

Running this command will automatically convert your Sass into CSS, outputting to `src/css/index.css` in real time.

To build the app for others to see your changes (production mode), type:

```
npm run-script build
```
